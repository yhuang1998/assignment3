Prepare a text file that contains text to analyze. It could be song lyrics to your favorite song. 

With your code, you’ll read from the text file and capture the data into a data structure.

Using a data structure, write the code to count the appearance of each unique word in the lyrics.

Print out a word frequency list. 


Example of the word frequency list:

100: frog

94: dog

43: cog

20: bog

Advice:
You can find song lyrics at https://genius.com/
Consider whether you want your keys to be case sensitive
Consider whether you want to include common stopwords such as the, a, is (more can be found at https://www.ranks.nl/stopwords)
Discuss with a classmate pro/cons of all steps if you’re rather indecisive
Examples can be found under the Maven folder
Examples of readme files github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme 

It is okay to start with the example code given in the repo, however please think about why you’re using whichever data structure you’ve selected for the task as you’ll have to write a description of your design rationale.
